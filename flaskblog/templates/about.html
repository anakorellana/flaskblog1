    I grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico with a wonderful family and amazing mom who always baked the best kick-a cakes. I would always pick up her recipe books to bake delicious pastries,  that was my favorite literature ( no, worries it has expanded as of recently!) It wasn’t until I lived in Paris for the first time at the age of 19 that food and specially desserts had a new meaning. As an avid runner I would be out and about around 5:30 am to make sure I’d be on time to school. There were always tantalizing smells emanating from every bakery near by as soon as I would step out my flat on Avenue de la Bourdonnais running through the Champs de Mars to crossing ‘Le Pont d’Iena’ to running uphill on rue de Passy until I would get to Bois de Boulogne. You better believe I would be thinking about that baguette or petit pain that I was gonna buy on my way back to my flat. Then there was 4 pm which only means one thing in France “Le Gouter’ snack time! On my way back home from La Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne I would explore different pastry shops or get another baguette which I will tell you more about on the recs. The experience of savoring creamy, velvety pastries or flaky pain au chocolat that melts in your mouth or baguette croquante was pure joy and still remains a joy. Because of that is that I decided to attend bread and pastry intensive courses at the Professional school of LeNotre in Plaisir to then open up my own Bakery. I had the honor to work at Maison Kayser as a Bread Maker or Boulanger where I had the opportunity to meet and learn from a great team and of course from Eric Kayser Himself. Then came the Bakery Meli Melo which I started at home and then opened up a shop which I eventually closed on the Spring of 2019. It was on a sunny beautiful Sunday morning of June 2019 that Peanut Butter Quesadilla was born in Midtown, Manhattan never knowing it was going to turn into your new favorite food blog coded by yours truly as a Python Developer months later. Because food and desserts have been one of the few constants in my life is that I decided to share this with you! I hope that through PeanutButter Quesadilla you can experience the joy of delighting your palate whether is by visiting the bakeries themselves or trying out a new recipe from our guest or myself. A table!

If you read up to this point you are amazing!

Thank you,
